Q) How do I contribute?

A) There are 2 ways to contribute. If you're a well known SPG2 modder already, then I'll set you up as a contributer, and you can directly edit the files. If you're new to the SPG2 Mod Scene, then you'll need to follow these steps:

1) Create a GitHub account, and preferably, although optional, download the GutHub software.

2) Fork this master repo.

3) Submit any changes you make to your fork.

4) Create a pull request between the masters of both your fork, and this repository.


Enough commits (that don't corrupt files!) and you'll be given contributer status.
