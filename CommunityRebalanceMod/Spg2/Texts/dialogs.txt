We're still late. We'll have to separate. Adrian, head for planet Trinity. Our cargo is ready, just pick it up and rendezvous with me. It's time for you to take on more responsibilities.
I was afraid you'll never notice I'm not a child anymore. I was ready to take your side a long time ago.
Trouble ahead. Pirates? I might as well see how this ship fares in some actual combat.
Not bad at all. This little ship can handle itself pretty well... But I should proceed to Trinity. I'll do some repairs while I'm down there.
Where the hell have you been so long?! Gabriel's in trouble! Avalon is under heavy attack! We must aid them immediately! Meet me there!
No father! No!!!
Damn, we are too late! Whoever did this already fled. Sensors are not picking up any survivors.
This cannot be! My father was causing no trouble. Why the hell would anyone do this?!
I'm very sorry for your loss, Adrian, very sorry. We'll find those responsible for this massacre. I promise you, but where to start?
Wait, my computer's log has just been updated. Some kind of automated message embedded in the memory core... It's from my father... God...He knew something like this could occur...why didn't he tell me? I could have...
...what? What could you have done? Die with him?! Gabriel was a brave and skilled warrior, and if he believed it was too dangerous, then it was! He sent you away to protect you! Respect that, kid! And be happy you are alive. Now you have the chance to investigate this and get even! I'm going to Trinity to see if local security caught any info on the attackers. You investigate those logs Gabriel left you and search the Avalon for clues...
Affirmative...I will find the bastards who did this, and I will kill them... all of them!
Hello Adrian. You don't know me, but your father was for a long time a very important member of the Gemini League, an organization that preceded today's Gemini Protectorate. We regret our help didn't reach you in time, but we are here now. The loss of Gabriel Faulkner is the loss for the entire Gemini. Please accept our help in finding the murderers. We offer any assistance you might need in pursuing this matter to the end. (CONTINUE CAMPAIGN)
Damn, kid! Seems the rest of your group has been scattered around or destroyed. I came here to offer assistance. Help me search and salvage anything useful from this battle and I'll put in a good word with my friends in the Outerlands. We could use capable recruits like you and we offer a life of freedom and possibilities. (FREEROAM | YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE STORY!)
Thank God it's you Adrian! Please help me get rid of these pests!
Thank you for the assist... I guess you are here for the data core...
Indeed I am. How do you know of it?
I have no idea what it is and I don't give a damn. My instructions were to transfer it to you in case... well, something happens. So, there you go, just take the damn thing, it almost cost me my head. And if you enjoy danger like your father did, I'll give you the possible location of another ship with this core: Yukon. Good hunting!
Adrian! Good, at least you survived.
I need something from your ship captain.
Let me guess...the bloody data core. What is on them worth getting killed?
I honestly don't know, but I will once I have them all.
Fine, whatever; don't tell me. You can have it, but your father's secrets almost cost me my ship. And, since he is gone, you can repay some of the debt. Bring me one fuel casing from the nearby junkyard to speed up my repairs and we'll call it even.
Already back? Efficient like your father. Good, here's your core, but a word of warning kid; whoever attacked us was very strong and very determined. Keep that in mind.
Don't worry. I'll hunt for them for as long as it's necessary!
I see you've made it in one piece and before you ask, I know what you need, probably the data core? Gabriel instructed me to hand it over to you if you appear and here you are.
Excellent. Thank you.
Not so fast. I'm just departing for Nordhorn Passage. You are welcome to tag along and help us out. Later, if we are still in one piece, you can have what you need. And I'll get the chance to see firsthand if true Faulkner blood runs through your veins.
I don't have time for games...
Really?! Well, I don't have time to waste on you then! My contract with Masada command is clear and urgent. Everything you need to know is in your log, the choice is yours.  If you are up to the challenge, meet me at the entrance into Nordhorn Passage.
Adrian, help me defend the rest of the freighters! We've already suffered heavy casualties!
Damn, those Anarchists are resilient! Junior, go to the end of the Passage and protect the rest of the convoy. Those bastards will surely try again. My ship is badly damaged and will remain here. When you secure the freighters, return to me.
I think they're all gone. Let's return to captain Jackson.
You did it? I knew it! Gabriel would have been proud. Take the core and do with it whatever you wish.
What about you? Do you need assistance?
Assistance? Son, I've been to hell and back and I never needed anybody to save my ass! I'll be just fine. Jackson out.
Excellent, you are here! It's a pleasure to meet another Faulkner in person. You are acquainted with captain Coop of the Galahad and it is best for you to contact him. His ship is on course to this station. Intercept him while we keep an eye on the Syndicate.
Adrian? Heavens, you are still alive?
Captain Coop? Where did you vanish after my father was killed? You've got something father left me...
I do? You mean the data core? Well, I do have it, but you can't have it I'm afraid. The old git brought me nothing but trouble and whatever is on the damned core, it may be worth just enough to cover my expenses.
You miserable traitor. You can't just take it like that!
To the contrary, I can! And I have friends to make sure I do!
You think this is over?! You are a fool like your old man! Have you got any idea what are you fighting against? Or who are you fighting with? Gabriel left the old League and "admiral" Kuzhev for a reason!
What are you talking about?
Enough chatting, damn it! Adrian, we are here to finish the job! Get back here and help us destroy this wretched station!
But, we have the core from Galahad! Syndicate outpost is of no relevance!
I will decide what's relevant! No one spits in the face of Protectorate. Syndicate will regret attacking my ships! Kuzhev to fleet: engage!
This is how problems are solved. The Syndicate will think twice before crossing our path again!
Who the hell is this now? Defensive positions! Adrian, leave now! We'll handle this!
Greetings and welcome freelancer. Are you here to join us in battle? We offer good entertainment and credits.
Battle? Not really, I'm here looking for you, captain Steiger.
Me? Oh, you are Faulkner's boy! Even better. Come with us on this raid. Let's see what you're made of and then we'll talk.
This is it gentlemen. Everything around you belongs to the bloody colonials. Destroy everything; no discrimination!
Not bad kid! That was some nice ass-kicking. We can be friends now hehehe.
Thanks I guess, now I would like...
I know what you want. Does the entire system need to know as well? Check your logs for what you need, I've relayed the info that can be of use to you. See you around...
It is a glorious day! Look at your radar. It's packed with targets, Imperial and Directorate pigs beating each other senseless! This might be the happiest day of my life! The prison is heavily damaged. Transport your troopers and grab Morse while I play with all those red radar blips!
I'm in your debt captain! Faulkner saves the day again. Not the Faulkner I've expected, but I'm still grateful! If I could ask for another favor... Could you destroy this friggin' prison? Some very unpleasant Directorate personnel handled me during my stay there and I'd like to repay the favor.
And that is that. You go ahead. I'll stay here a bit... and have some fun hahaha!
Captain, I shall remain with you for the time being and help you out. If you have read my report, you understand it is imperative we contact dr. Ridley. But, if she decides to stay in the shadows, it will be a hard task. I have a friend on Yxaril station in Wasteland. He might be able to assist us. Please check your log for more details before we travel there.
This is the place. I contacted my associate, and he will have the papers ready soon. However, since he is a wanted person in several sectors, no direct contact will be established. Papers will wait for us at the ruins of Tesla station, as soon as we do him a small favor.
A small favor... of course...
Well, the man is taking a great risk. We need to eliminate an elite assassin squad, probably MultiOps, that is stalking him in the vicinity.
Great, he is gone. We are receiving coordinates of the cargo container that holds what we need.
There is a freelance job offered to repair several relay satellites in Nexus Perimeter. We could take it and while we conduct repairs, I'll tap into their commlink and look for anything useful, discreetly. It is better than just shoot out questions about Ridley, given her current reputation in these parts.
Excellent. Mr. Morse, remind me never to ask you where you trained your talents.
Find anything useful?
Indeed. Review your log for my findings. I think Will o' the Wisp is our best bet.
For the love of God, help me! My escort is destroyed and those revenant freaks don't let go!
I appreciate the help captain. Freakin' Nexus experiments almost cost me my ship.
What experiment? Is that linked to a ship called "Redemption" perhaps?
It is actually. Redemption came here and asked for info about some Radley person or ship Archimon, or something like that... All I know is that when they left, revenants appeared and I'm sure it wasn't accidental. Everybody knows Nexus is always tampering with that rift crap.
Do you know where they went?
While we talked to the Redemption, I accidentally engaged my little worm program that recorded some data from their mainframe. Incidentally, their flight plan was in there. If you want it, you can have it, but it will cost you. Protect me until I complete repairs to get the hell out of here.
You saved my skinny ass once again. Thank you. The data is now uploaded to your computer. But I tell you, Nexus ships are a magnet for troubles. You really should reconsider if it's worth any risk.
Nice bundle of data. Redemption plans to visit Stasis Ground One, not far from here and test new extraction procedures.
Captain, Redemption is blown away. We need to search the wreck for clues.
Let's first handle these revenants so we can work in peace.
What a pitiful end. Redemption was destroyed by the very same revenants it saved from riftspace. More interesting is the fact that before its demise, crew succeeded to track down a faint stasis signal here. Someone used extraction technology on this spot a short time before Redemption did and Archimedes is the only ship with this technology that I'm aware of.
Ridley? How can we contact her if she is still near?
I have an idea. We'll transmit a distress call using old Gemini League algorithms. Nobody uses those anymore, but it might jog her memory and get her attention. Transmitting now...
Congratulations gentleman. You have found me. Now, who are you and what do you want from me?
Dr. Ridley, you have worked with my father, Gabriel Faulkner and now I need your help.
He is telling the truth Elenor, we really need you.
Morse? What are you doing here? I heard you were in prison.
Long story. Young Faulkner here rescued me and we're trying to complete Gabriel's work. Our work!
Finally someone with the courage to pursue real truth. Excellent. We cannot talk here and like this. Nexus and Brotherhood are everywhere. I'll review your data and think of a way to help you. Until then it's best we do not travel together. Talk to you soon, and junior, welcome aboard; you are in for a hell of a ride...
We are ready to start. Keep an eye on our surroundings. If the Stiletto shows up, keep them occupied.
Great work! Now, transport troops to the station and secure it. Whoever you encounter, consider armed and dangerous. Who knows what happened to them during their stay in riftspace.
It's all yours. How about that protocol now?
No worries; we're on it, but you have to give me some time.
Right on time. Oh-oh... Crap! I'm reading stasis disturbance nearby, something's de-cloaking! I knew it couldn't be that easy! Adrian, the Brotherhood will attack us and we cannot afford to lose the Terakon. I'll shield it. You deal with the Brotherhood. And be quick about it!
Brotherhood? Excellent, we have some debts to settle!
This is Sanctuary defense force. You are in violation of Sanctuary peacekeeping act. Hostilities within Sanctuary borders will not be tolerated!
Fighting? We were ambushed! Is self-defense a crime?!
Irrelevant. Any fighting in the region is against the law. If you can't settle your differences elsewhere, we'll settle them for you.
Ok ok. It's over now, no more fighting.
Good. Consider this your last warning!
Having trouble with Sanctuary peacekeepers? We're almost done here. I got what we needed from the Terakon.
Ok, can we go now?
I need a few minutes to charge my drive, it was drained while extending stasis field. ... Damn it, not again! More Brotherhood incoming! Defend me until I can restart my engines!
You have been warned! Repeated violation of our laws is punishable by death!
My propulsion is back online. Let's get the hell away from here!
That's it. We're out. Contact me when you're ready to proceed. I'm off to get repaired.
I never thought I'll see this beast again.
Old memories huh? From what I heard, it was a brutal battle.
Oh yes it was. Look at this monster. Even destroyed it looks scary. The last time I saw the Leviathan, it was raining hell on all of us. You'd have been proud seeing your father alongside general Demetrius that day... They charged with no fear and I know we were all scared to death.
I wish I could have seen it. Strange... I've never imagined my father as a fearless warrior...
Extraordinary situations make us do extraordinary things. I suspect you'll realize that in time too. Somehow I don't think destiny intended an easier path for you Adrian. ...
Captain, transport my team to the Leviathan, but stay on alert. Our presence won't be welcomed by the local outlaw groups.
I think we have what we need. I'm returning to ship.
This is the plan. My colleagues from Hub maintain this local grid and will turn a blind eye to our work here. We have to tap into the correct Imperial frequency.
And how do you intend to do that? Ask them nicely to transmit something top secret?
Amusing... There are two ways. Just wait for a secure channel to be activated, or provoke them to use it. Since we can't stay here for weeks, forcing them is the obvious solution.
Attack the Empire?! I'm not that much into suicides!
You're not a coward either, right? You don't have to conquer the Empire, just force them to call for reinforcements, or convince them you are greater threat than you appear. I've detected a small Imperial patrol returning from Baeldor. They're isolated and damaged; simply perfect for the task.
To the commander of the Imperial patrol. Surrender your ships or you will be destroyed by ahhh... Baeldor recon fleet!
Destroying their ship is more likely to draw attention... if I may suggest.
That did the trick. Emergency distress signal has been sent and Ridley caught it in time. She'll do the rest.
This is it. No turning back. Details are specified in your log. Just follow the plan and hope for the best.
What about you once we pass to the other side?
Don't concern yourself with that. As soon as I release you from jumpdrive field, your only task is to reach that wormhole in one piece.
Understood. And find Demetrius on the other side.
Adrian, you do realize it could be hell there? We have no idea what defenses the Empire has in mainspace. No ship of ours has been there for decades.
If I live, you'll get my report firsthand. Let's do this!
While you are there, I'll prepare a diversion to use once you get back. The trick with the security grid won't work twice. Now, move out!
There's a whole armada here. Hurry! The defense grid is offline! It is now or never! Good luck!
Son of a... What the hell happened here?! Where's the Empire? The hell is going on?!
I'll be damned... short range sensors are picking up only a massive debris field...
Someone messed up the Empire real bad. Wide area scan. There's got to be something still standing... then we'll see how and where to proceed.
Scan indicates strange fluctuations in the vicinity. Our latest maps say we'll find battlestation Salazar there. Or at least we should...
Thank God! You're not with the A'Shriari! You here to help? We haven't received any reinforcements for months!
"A'" what? Who are they? ... Who are you?
Are you messing with me? What planet are you from? A'Shriari brought the Empire down! And my resistance and I are all that remains from the government! Shit man, you are really lost! I'm sending you the coordinates of our compound. Meet me there and we'll see what to make of you.
This is the situation... Who you are and what you want is of no relevance at this point. Obviously you are not an alien and your worry-free stomp around here says you haven't got a clue as to what's going on, so I doubt you stand with any of the other groups either. You are however a captain with a functioning ship and that means you can be of use to us. Our base is open to you for repairs, but hospitality comes with a price...
I expected that. What do you need?
We need industrial plants, soldiers and a formidable armada, but given the situation, some spare parts and medical supplies would suffice. We are sending you the coordinates of several locations our recon has identified to be of interest. Gather the supplies you find there and bring them back here. You're in better condition than any of us, but beware; we are not the only ones on the look-out!
What about the aliens?
Let's just hope you don't run into them. And if you do, don't bring them back here!
Excellent! Now, something a bit more demanding. Our resistance needs more ships and we also need to send out a message of strength. Only then can we hope to unite more resistance groups into a larger movement! We'll send all the ships we can spare with you to raid Huntworth shipyard. It's held by Mercury opposition and contains a number of functioning vessels. Lead the attack against the installation defenders, while my men secure the ships.
Ships are yours. Now, what about my problem?
I've checked your data and you are in luck. We are familiar with this Damocles you're looking for. Captain Demetrius right? He came here after the evacuation to Gemini; poor bastard had no idea what happened here, but he sure knew how to fight. A'Shriari finally trapped him near the Military Academy, Bastilla. That's all I know. If you plan to seek him out, know that that region is en route of regular A'Shriari patrols.
Oh my God! That's the Damocles. The bastards got to it after all... rest in peace general... I guess fate wanted you to die alone, far from home... Captain, we are ready to transport. Let's get the decipher...
Time's up! A'Shriari patrol has sniffed us out. We gotta get out of here! Set course for Starpoint!
Vo masfenda el kaufrii d'saleem A'shriari! Kal maratoo di baqi!
What the hell is he... she... whatever saying?
Does it matter? Their weapons are a good enough description of their intentions! ... We are almost there, Signal to Ridley has been sent. I hope she figured out a way to pick us up safely on the other side...
Welcome back! Hurry, reach my position. We can use the Brotherhod's assault to slip away!
What happened there?
Your little trip didn't go unnoticed. And someone doesn't want you to report what you've seen on the other side.
Could be, on the other side of Starpoint is total hell. The Empire is gone!
Gone? How? And Demetrius?
I'm not yet sure myself, but some aliens had a major role in it. And, I'm afraid, Demetrius is gone...
Aliens?! My God. We'll have to put the new information into perspective very carefully. We should separate. My ship needs repairs, and in the meantime, I'll use the decipher key to finally decode Faulkner's data...
Captain, time is short! Data from Demetrius and your father is now wanted merchandise! Multiple vessels are approaching Clearmont. I've informed admiral Kuzhev of our findings, but many will now want what we have! Defend the station while I meet with Clearmont officials.
My name is Dr. Thomas Scott and on the behalf of Nexus I demand access to your data. Ridley helped you obtain them using classified Nexus technology and that means the data belongs to us!
I don't think so. It was my father's work and we went through a whole lot of trouble to get them!
So what? Your miserable brain can't use them anyway. We can do it the hard way as well.
Scott?! Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how important this is? And what's at stake?!
Are you preaching again, Morse? Demetrius preached a lot too and where is he now? Where's your League? Why don't you just accept you had your chance and you screwed everything up!
So, you will save us all now? Is that it?! You friggin egomaniac!
Well, I can't do any worse than you! Look at my face and tell me your way was the right one! You failed to save Gemini, Nexus was almost destroyed and our scientific work stolen! What was the purpose?! I will not do the same mistake of trusting you again!
Problems? Oh, I see, it's that nutjob Scott! If you want it, come and get it!
Wow, Kuzhev is here too! Another League failure. It's good Demetrius is gone. He'd be ashamed to look at you all!
Clearmont staff had some success in Lens research, but there's no more time. Sensors indicate high level stasis disturbance. Something big is coming. Just buy me a few more minutes to transport the scientists to my ship.
Brotherhood is coming! We can't hold all of them! Prepare to withdraw!
Damn you Kuzhev! Damn you Ridley! And damn this cursed Brotherhood! This isn't over yet!
I evacuated some of them, but we must escape now. They are boarding the station!
Faulkner? Just you? Ah this will be fun! Nyx is approaching. Give them hell or if nothing else, die with dignity!
Steiger? It's good to see you again, especially if we're to enter a battle with odds stacked against us. Don't underestimate our young captain. He's already proven himself worthy of the Faulkner name.
We'll see soon enough. Kuzhev employed the entire Gladius group to help out with this fight and that can mean only one thing: a whole lot of trouble is rolling our way. But I'll never pass on an offer to kill Imperial bastards and Nyx traitors!
You fight well, kid. Old Faulkner taught you how to survive. Good; you'll need it. I have a feeling this was just the beginning...
Thank you captain Steiger. Masada is safe for now, but I'm afraid we are walking away from important things; the Brotherhood...
Patience my young friend. If we don't stop the Empire and its allies from spreading everywhere, you can say goodbye to anything you were doing before. I'm sure Kuzhev knows what he's doing.
Welcome young Faulkner. Admiral Kuzhev said to expect you. You know we have no love for the Empire, but we cannot open another front against them until Nexus is pacified.
I understand, but I must stress I disagree with Kuzhev's tactics. Our objective should be the Brotherhood and the Lens! Besides, how can one ship help you?
You should consider the big picture here. The Empire is on the offensive and Nexus apparently works in their favor. If the Empire prevails, what are your chances to seek out the Brotherhood then in an occupied Gemini? And Baeldor cannot help you or the Protectorate for as long as Nexus uses that blasted Catapult to launch raids deep into our territory!  You have the permission to enter Nexus Perimeter. All we need is for you to disable several relay nodes there. Then, we can send more ships to attack their bloody Catapult. Without it, Nexus military isn't too great of a threat. I'm sending the coordinates of the nodes that must be taken out.
Excellent work! We're now free to launch our main strike against Nexus. They won't know what hit them!
Let's do this. First task is to eliminate the guardposts surrounding the Catapult. Then you provide protection for the Archimedes while I tamper with station's stasis stabilizers...
Oh it's our lost sheep, Elenor. Here to destroy our greatest achievement? You were always a fool!
I'm a fool? Look at you Scott! Kissing Imperial asses! You make me sick!
Think what you wish, but you fail to see the big picture. What did defeating the Directorate and the Empire bring us in the past? At least they provided order and peace! Now, with my Catapult and once the Empire secures the Lens, we'll be able to build what you and your naive general Demetrius destroyed!
You trust Empire to build a better future? If we secure the Lens, we can flush out the Brotherhood and make everything right!
Really? Like your father did? No thanks, I'll rather trust the Empire to do the dirty work and then investigate the Lens on my own terms! You pursue your own little vengeance, while Kuzhev's pitiful organization fights to keep things as they are. Don't you see I'll have a chance to discover and use alien technology to make a difference in the entire universe, even beyond Starpoint?
This is pointless. There is no talking to this maniac! Engage!
Fantastic job people! Now we can turn our attention to the Empire and open a new front to relieve Kuzhev. I'm returning to Baeldor to supervise the preparations.
Our work here is done. Maybe we can now assure Kuzhev to turn his attention back to the Lens...
Brave soldiers of Gemini! This is the day we've been waiting for. Imperial forces are gathered in the Serpent and all we need is one decisive blow.
But, admiral... what about the Lens? Empire left it weakly defended and if we act now, we could recapture it and finish investigating its power.
I agree. At the same time, we just might be able to pinpoint the Brotherhood's location and destroy them.
No! Empire is ready to die at last and we cannot miss the opportunity to finish this! They have no logistics in mainspace, no reinforcements, nothing! One more crippling strike and they will be gone! And the Brotherhood? Cavurian is hitting them hard, why should we interfere? Are you suggesting we put your personal vengeance before the fate of Gemini?
Come on Kuzhev, Faulkner is not saying that at all, but we must understand that the Brotherhood is a dangerous threat! The Empire isn't pursuing them so viciously without a good reason!
I agree with Ridley, Empire is not the greatest threat here! If the Brotherhood finds a way to shut down the Lens, those same aliens that wiped out the Empire could come here!
That's bullshit! We don't even know if the aliens have anything against us! Maybe the Imperial malice is what provoked them to attack. In any case, do you see any alien vessels here? No! You don't, so let me bother with the threat at hand and leave other worries aside. The Empire falls today and this discussion is over! Once I have the Grand Admiral's head, we can talk more!
What a glorious day! Me and an ocean of Imperial hardware in pieces! I dreamt this day would come so many times! The Grand Admiral escaped, but the core of his might is gone and nothing can stop us now! In a few days the twin suns of Gemini will warm my face, hahahaha...
Our mission won't be a walk in the park after all. Cavurian managed to withdraw to the Lens with several ships from his Alpha wing. It appears they are ready to defend this sector to the last man.
How many lives does that man have? Ok, I'll handle Cavurian and his flagship the Seraphim. You concentrate on support ships and possible automated defenses.
All imperial ships are gone, but Cavurian transferred to Clearmont station with his elite guards. My team and I are in for a fight.
Ah, that imperial dog is here! Hiding like a coward. Well, if this is the kind of death he wants... Destroy the station!
Wait admiral! My team's over there!
Bring them back then! That Imperial bastard is not getting away again!
Damn it Kuzhev! There is no need for this!
That's my decision and this is war which I intend to finish at last!
Morse, return to the ship immediately. Override the mainframe. We'll grab what data we can remotely.
Admiral, we should try to seize Clearmont intact!
I've had enough of taking advices from civilians. This is a war and leave war to soldiers. Imperial forces destroyed everything in their path pursuing the Brotherhood. Is it worth it? My obligation is to Gemini and its citizens!
But Cavurian isn't a threat. He wants to keep the Lens intact, as do we!
That may be, but are you ready to trust him? After all the bloodshed the Empire caused? I'm not! Eliminating Cavurian and putting Lens under Protectorate control is the only thing that will satisfy me.
And where is the Brotherhood now anyway?
They are in pieces scattered across Serpent. I don't think they'll be an issue any more. Now, stand back and let me say one last hello to the Grand Admiral.
It is ok. We have more than enough data. Some fascinating things are here...
Are you ready captain? This isn't gonna be easy. A wounded animal is the most dangerous animal.
I'm ready. I just thought my father's killers would be brought to justice by now... or that I'll be working on that.
Adrian, this is important! Your father dedicated his entire life to free and protect Gemini. Now, you have a chance to fulfill his goal. Maybe things didn't go as you planned, but what better way is there to honor him than to complete what he worked on for so long?
Exactly, and this isn't over yet. I doubt we have seen the last of the Brotherhood.
Don't worry, just get us there and we'll see this to the end together. My father fought the Empire his entire life and I have a chance to finish at least some of his life's work.
Let's go! Kuzhev is ready to start the operation.
Father, this is for you! Die imperial scum!
Captain Faulkner, Imperial commander is signaling unconditional surrender of his fleet. There are only a handful of ships that refused and are on course to Starpoint. They would rather try their luck against the aliens on the other side. Intercept and destroy them!
I honor this victory in the name of my friend and comrade Paul Demetrius. General... we finally did it! The Empire is reduced to ashes and your name shall never be forgotten among the free people of Gemini!
Captain, we've got Brotherhood ships de-cloaking!
What?! Kuzhev, you said they were destroyed in the Serpent!
Obviously not all of them! I guess you'll have your revenge after all!
Come on bastards! Die and remember my father forever!
Oh my God! Incoming ships from Starpoint. What are they?
They are aliens we encountered in on the other side. The A'Shriari.
They are attacking! Admiral Kuzhev, I hope this answers your questions regarding their intentions!
Not today, oh no! I don't care what they are, they are not welcome here! Attack them!
No one will ever stand against the Protectorate again! Alien or human! Theta wing; set up a defensive perimeter around Starpoint and stand ground until we investigate what this suicidal attack was all about. They had to be aware the Lens is still operational and we can fight them!
Oh, it's our famous renegade child, Elenor Ridley. This is the end of your journey!
What the hell are you doing Scott? First the Imperials and now siding with the Brotherhood? Have you lost your mind?
Think what you wish, but you will not stop us again. You never could grasp the big picture.
What big picture? The Brotherhood is a bunch of killers and if they succeed, A'Shriari aliens will wipe us all out! Is that what you want?!
They are killers? And you didn't kill thousands to reach your goal? Besides, you surprise me Ridley, where is your scientific passion? Don't you see how magnificent these hybrids are? They could elevate humans to reach new levels! And you want to destroy that possibility?
Magnificent? Ask my father how magnificent they are! 'Cold blooded murderers' suits them better!
Whatever you think, Scott, you cannot pull it off. The Protectorate is on its way. Nexus is finished!
That may be, but I have no intention to stay here for long anyway. Our new Brotherhood friends gave us access to enough Lens technology to duplicate it. We have no need of Gemini any more.
And where do you intend to go? Starpoint is under our control!
You are one step behind me again Ridley! You always were! Catapult has been upgraded to virtually limitless range. I can go wherever I want! But, enough talk, you must die now so we can finish our preparations!
We must hurry! Protectorate arrived and Kuzhev already engaged Nexus near the Catapult. We don't have much time! Scott wasn't deceiving us. Catapult shows massive energy build-up. Meet me there!
Oh God! Scott connected the Mothership to the Catapult. They must be draining the Mothership's power core to supply the Catapult's new upgrades.
They are running away?! Hell no! Those bastards killed my father and I'll be damned if I don't burry them right here!
Careful Adrian! First sever the link between the Mothership and the Catapult! And do it before they are all gone!
That's one of them! Hurry up! The Catapult is launching more of them every second!
Just one more. Catapult's field is already collapsing!
You're mine now! Nowhere to go! Meet your creator, whoever it is!
It's done. Are you ok Adrian?
Much better. These killers made my life a living hell and now they have the chance to burn in one. There is some consolation in that.
Great work people! Nexus is ours too! Don't worry Adrian; those that fled will feel our wrath soon too!
It is good the fight is over. We deserve some peace finally.
Peace? No, my young friend; that would be a mistake. There is still work to be done.
I don't follow.
With the Lens technology in our hands, Ridley and you can duplicate its effect and protect our ships against the aliens even beyond Starpoint. Without the Empire, it is our duty to save humanity everywhere in the known universe.
Are you kidding? We did all this work so you could start an even larger war?
This will be one last war to unite humanity under one banner!
Yes... I guess it will be your banner Kuzhev? God, that sounds like imperial propaganda!
Watch yourself Adrian! You are talking to the Admiral and Protector of Gemini! Don't say something you might regret. Do you think we went through all this trouble just so you can have your revenge? Your father wouldn't be so selfish!
God, not again... It seems there really is no end to this chaos... Am I going to spend my entire life on a battlefield like my father? Are we truly a damned race?...
Sakkara to all ships in the vicinity: we're under heavy attack! Please assist! I repeat we need assistance!
We owe you our lives captain! Thank you, but I fear our troubles have just begun. You are the only surviving allied ship and the station is heavily damaged. I'll contact my command about your payment and to see how to proceed.
Happy to help. Please tell your superiors I'm open for further assistance. Faulkner out.
Where have you been for so long? The Maelstrom is not an area you want to stay in for long. These shields are good, but not indestructible. I see you have my credits.
This is highway robbery, you do know that?
If you don't want it, don't buy it.
You know damn well I have no choice If I'm to go into Aethera. I'm transferring the payment. You transport the enhancer and we'll be on our way.
Good, I'm sending the blueprints now. And remember, if anybody asks, I've never saw you in my life.
I can hardly believe this! Kepler really still stands! We must send men across to evaluate the situation. Link live data feed to Sakkara. I want them to see this directly.
Away team, search the mainframe for clues, we have some hostiles to deal with here!
Bring our people back and make sure the collected data gets to Sakkara.
This is dr. Stephen Reading, if somebody is reading this, please assist. NeoPhysics is in control of Kepler station once more, but we are seriously short on personnel and require assistance.
This is good, let's wait a while and see if anyone responds.
That's not who I wanted to see...
You really are a moron...whoever you are! If you are faking a signal, can't you at least try to fake it properly? I don't remember having a twin brother and last time I checked, I was actually white so do your homework! I don't think my colleagues would believe you were me when you didn't look like me and I am me, not you...
What?... Doc... stop, please... I don't even know what you just said... I apologize, but it was important to reach your team. The mess you've created must be cleared and Porphyria secured.
Naturally, I'm already one step ahead of you. I'm surprised it wasn't two steps or three or a small jump... There is a way to shut down Kepler's generator safely, but we need unrefined shard ore to amplify our stasis stabilizers so they don't cause ruptures everywhere. Go get me some from Sea of Sorrow.
Why don't you get it yourself?
Why? Why?! I don't know... You are me, so you go get it. Or I get it and you make the preparations here and then we'll...
Oh for the love of God! ... This is pointless. I'm going.
My ships tell me you've arrived. Good. Keep an eye out for pirates. Members of the Shard group will likely see our intrusion as an insult and attack us.
Affirmative commander.
Nice work captain Faulkner. Mining ships have collected enough material to get to Dr. Reading.
At last. Your Porphyrian friends delivered the shard ore as agreed. My team is already at the station working on the generator. You must be prepared, once the generator is shut down, stasis field will drop instantly, and we cannot say how many ships are nearby in different cloak or rift anomalies. Maybe...well, doesn't matter, just be ready.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Just be silent and keep an eye out!
What a weird guy...
Damnation! Help! Now! Our ships are not ready for combat, get rid of the Ghosts!
Great. Now leave us to work in peace. Aethera disturbance should be reduced quickly, so you can inform your Porphyrian gods that danger is gone.
Gods? You have some issues, doc...
Bite me...
I'm not sure if the nebula got to him, or if he was always nuts.
Abandoning our research?! Are you insane? We are so close! Captain Faulky, could you talk some sense into your sweetums commander?
Dr. Reading, why risk another catastrophe? Wasn't the first one enough?
Breaking barriers is always a risk, but I'm sure no incident will occur this time. And more importantly, our MultiOps contractors wouldn't like to lose their money.
Is that why my people must risk their lives? Profit? I cannot listen to this anymore! Dr. Reading, your license to continue work in Aethera is revoked, effecting immediately! This is still Porphyrian territory and our decision is final!
Fool! Twit! Imbecile! You cannot stop progress! Make us leave if you want to and if you can! ... Mmmm canned food.... I'd like some...
All vessels: eliminate NeoPhysics ships and their insane leader!
It is done. I'll transfer my HQ to Kepler station for now. Someone must monitor the situation from here. As for you, captain Faulkner, your service in this crisis has been exemplary. I think you deserve an extra reward. My team is transporting you several weapon and ship system blueprints developed by NeoPhysics on this station in recent years. Put them to good use. Thank you and farewell.
Thank you very much, commander Camire. It's been a pleasure working with you. I'm just sorry it had to end up this way. Farewell!
Stop your ship immediately! Your vessel is being investigated in connection with the bombing of Prosperity station. You will be boarded and inspected!
The hell we are! Attack Sanctuary security! Our mission must be completed without interruptions!
Ah, my secret surprise arrives. Respective commanders of Protectorate, the very best among you will now face captain Faulkner. He has no military training, but is resourceful and experienced. Despite what most of you believe, in a few moments you'll see if you still have anything to learn...
Have you seen this gentlemen? This is triumph of determination and experience over formal training and youth arrogance. Remember that if you still think there is nothing more to learn!
Excellent work captain. You are worth every credit we are paying. Now, could we ask another favor? These lunatic shard worshipers obviously have some kind of technology that allows them to anticipate asteroid phasing. It could be very useful to our research. Naturally, Union will reward such effort handsomely.
Interesting, one of Shard vessels is damaged. We'll eliminate others from his group and then board disabled one.
I guess this phase detector is precisely what Union team is seeking. Let's return the device to them.
Brilliant work! I wish I had more people like you in my team.
Excellent captain! We'll get it to processing right away.
Damn! Station is under lockdown. We'll have to dispose of Baeldor attackers before we can dock!
Captain, latest reports show the rogue cyborgs took over the facility. Mission priority is as of now changed. You are to purge the area of any cyborg activity. They must not be allowed to spread!
You represent the best Triad can throw at us? Haha, that's amusing! How about you just die!
I think this will do. Dozen Lagarde wrecks floating around are enough to make them think twice before launching operations beyond their borders again.
Excellent. Our Syndicate friends are here to collect. Away teams, withdraw to ship.
Faulkner? Famous name. I remember your father. If you are half the man he was, Nyx is in for a real trouble! Brace yourself, here they come!
Magnificent! Those idiots really can't accept defeat. Faulkner, great work, I hope we'll work together again in the future.
Let's do this fast. I don't like the radiation hitting our ship.
Excellent. Transmit the data to Salazar over a secure channel and get us out of here!
Men, plan is simple. We cross the border and head for Caridad complex. Destroy everything Nyxian along the way. Once there, I and my crew will handle the station. Rest of you; clear the defenses and hostile ships. Oh, and of course, plunder everything useful!
This is it! Attack!
Excellent! Thank you Faulkner. Your assistance was invaluable. Salazar to Rogues: time to plunder boys!
Welcome captain. Agents will be on your ship in a moment. Good luck with your mission.
Here we go! Reports were accurate. Multiple vessels with Imperial markings are approaching fast!
All ships, defensive positions! Protect the envoy ships!
Thanks for the assist captain Faulkner. We couldn't have done it without you.
Welcome, young captain Faulkner. If you are ready, let's proceed. Baeldor ships will concentrate on Anatolia defense station. Hunt down as many imperial ships as you can. Strong auxiliary units of the Empire will be alarmed soon, and once they are on the move, we are leaving. Our mission is just to show them Baeldor is not afraid to strike back if forced to!
Reinforcements are closing in! Retreat from imperial space now! Good work everyone!
Impressive work, captain... truly impressive...
We'll take care of the security forces first so they don't call for backup.
Away teams: prepare to board the dormant ships. Grab what you can from their mainframes and get back.
There was no useful data there. Colunga was destroyed immediately upon arrival in Crysalys. Looks like someone knew they were coming...
Is there any way to get the surveillance data from another source?
Just one. There is a Thaurian outpost nearby. I can boost sensors and record data from here. Colunga had acquired the appropriate frequency. But, we'll need to remain here and keep an open channel for several minutes. Several enemy ships are approaching so that will pose a problem.
So, you are here to rescue your spies? Too late! We are no fools. We knew you are coming. But trust me, you will stay here permanently, just like your friends!
Done! Let's get out of here! Head for the wormhole now!
I knew this is one fight you wouldn't want to miss! Concentrate on defending ships and guardposts before our elite troops can be deployed to Ares station.
Captain, our troops are fighting for control of the station. Lehmann's ship the Anaconda fled deep into the asteroid field. Follow him and show him true justice!
Captain, the Anaconda is history, but we have Lehmann! He was transported just moments before his ship was destroyed!
Excellent, we'll take him to Derrick.
Well, this is more than we hoped for! "Arbiter" Lehmann, alive and caged... I know that Thaurian insurgency is far from over, but retaking Heraclean Stretch and public trial of this traitor should give us enough time to get some breath. Excellent work captain! Korkyra is in your debt!
Captain we've scanned your cargo hold and found illegal substances. Stop your ship and jettison the contraband or face consequences!
Security has been notified!
Security forces are en route. Remain in the vicinity!
That was not a good idea. We're sending someone over there.
Poor choice captain. We don't like when someone messes with our stuff.
To the unknown ship. Security forces are under way.
That's no way to act in a civilized society. I'm afraid you'll have to be destroyed.
You destroy something of ours... we destroy you. That's how it works.
Just sit tight. I'll have someone escort you to the other side in a few moments.
Not smart. Noooot smart.
Remain calm. I'll have someone come over and kill you in a minute.
Hey! Don't touch my glowies!
That's MY anomaly!
You scan... you die!
Can't touch this!
I thank you for pulling my arse from the anomaly, but I'm afraid I cannot let you live...
What?! Where?! You! YOU got me in this mess. Dieeee!
Erm... I'm simply going to assume you're responsible for getting me trapped in there.
Nice ship you got there. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it...
Aim for the eyeees!
For the Emp... oh... never mind. Die!
I've seen things... on the other side... Baaaaad things...
Thank you friend. I would've been stuck there probably for a long time.
I appreciate the assistance captain. Come find me on Tortuga and I'll buy you a drink.
Thank you for the help, friend. We hope to pay you back some day.
Attacking you would be illogical. Farewell.
Ahhhh... nothing like being free again. Thank you captain!
Thanks a bunch. I was sure I was a goner.
Why thank you stranger. That's a mighty nice thing you did there.
What?! Where?! You! You freed me? Thanks man!
Thanks for saving my skin. My crew and I are grateful captain.
We're getting a stream of data from the probe. I'll reroute the info to HUB scientists.
Is that...? It’s a mine!
Whatever that anomaly was, it transported us far away. Navigation is getting our position.
Something is emerging from the anomaly... It's a wreckage.
Some strange energy field encompassed our ship, captain. Whatever it was, it boosted our power core.
We're getting some strange readings. Whatever is coming out of that anomaly, it's repairing micro-fractures on our hull.
Brace for impact! Energy surge detected!
Mine mine miiiiineeeee!
I guess you haven't heard, but this derelict belongs to me.
No no no. That simply won't do. You can't have that salvage.
You thinkin' of taking profit from ME? I think not!
Want that salvage? How about no...
Get your greedy little hands off my salvage!
Nu-huh. Ain't gonna happen. My scrap-heap!
Hey! That's my junk!
I have salvage rights here buddy. You're out of the picture!
I see dead people... namely YOU!
There was something highly explosive on that derelict, sir. It gave quite a punch. Engineering is reporting damage.
Greetings captain. We're here to help.
We were sent to provide assistance commander.
Help arrives!
Let's kick some butt captain!
Excellent! You're here. Let's deal with those hostiles.
Time to die!
Coming here was not a good idea.
I'm coming for you captain. Your time's up.
No no no... You coming here was a baaaad idea.
I come... you die. Simple as that...
Interesting cargo. I wouldn't mind having it in my cargo hold...
Hmmm... I think you'll part with that cargo you're carrying... NOW!
Don't mind me captain. I'm just here for the cargo. Attack!
To all friendly vessels: assistance required!
We're taking heavy casualties. Please assist!
To all friendlies: We're under attack! Help would be appreciated!

It's hit the fan! To all friendlies: we're under heavy fire! Please assist!
We got ambushed! Please assist ASAP!
Under attack! Give us a hand here captain!
Can you help out in repairs captain?
Care to lend a hand captain? We're on a tight schedule, but our repairs here are killing us.
Borrow us a few engineers captain... just for a few quick system repairs...
Help needed! Our engines are overheating... blast imminent! To any friendly vessel: please help!
Our power core is soon to explode! All nearby vessels: Leave the area or assist ASAP!
Any good in engineering captain? We've got a problem here that needs fixing. Care to help?
Hey friend! Can you aid my crew in restarting the power core? My Team seems to be made up of a bunch of rookies.
To all ships: We're abandoning the post. Without immediate repairs, we're done for!
Assistance needed! Micro-meteor shower damaged us severely. We're losing oxygen! Please assist!
To any vessel with capable engineers: Your help is needed! We're losing pressure!
We're in for a nasty end if you don't help out captain! Life support systems out... engineering team in sickbay...
To all friendlies: We've survived an enemy onslaught. Urgent repairs needed if you can spare the time...
Convoy under attack! We need assistance!
Our escort fleet is almost all gone. We need protection!
We've got enemies jumping in all over the convoy. Please help! We cannot last much longer!
This is a distress call to all friendly vessels: Half of our convoy managed to jump, but we're stuck! Help!
Convoy needs support! They've taken down our defense ships. Taking heavy damage!
Distress call: We're on a collision course with a planet! Our controls are out! [Grapple the ship and tow it away]
Distress call: Our afterburners went nuts! Can anyone help out?! We've lost all control! [Grapple the ship and tow it away]
We're stuck in an anomalous area. Engines are out! Can you help us?! Grapple us and get us the heck away from this! [Grapple the ship and tow it away]
Please assist! Our shields are almost gone... hull is taking damage. Engines are fried! This anomaly is killing us! [Grapple the ship and tow it away]
To all friendly vessels: We've lost all helm control and are on a collision course with a station! Assistance needed! [Grapple the ship and tow it away]
SOS: Wormhole has damaged our thrusters. We're drifting towards a nearby station. Please help out! [Grapple the ship and tow it away]
Wanna join me in defeating a rogue, captain?
To all friendly ships. We9ve got a big name bounty pinned down here. Converge on my position and help us out!
Captain! Care to earn some credits? Join me in a fight against this wanted criminal and we'll split the profit.
To any captain in need of some quick cash. I've got a wanted criminal here tagged. Anyone who helps me in taking him down, gets a cut.
Up for a fight captain? Assist me in taking this wanted mug down and we split the reward 50-50.
I got some bounty hunters on my rear. Got time to help a friend?
Hey friend. Care to help out an outlaw buddy? I've got some bounty hunters on my back.
Sir! I'm being hunted! Help me out!
Hey cap'! Interested in a convoy raid? Join me! You keep what you take.
Captain, there's a convoy passing by. I think I'm going to get me some loot. Join me if you're interested.
Hey there friend! Wanna hit a convoy with me? My sources tell me the cargo's good.
Got to do a number on an installation nearby. Wanna help me out? We can split the reward!
Captain... I got a job to... erm... "fix" a structure. If you give a helping hand, I'll give you a part of the reward...
Oy! We're heading for that station nearby. If you join us, I'll make it worth your while.
I'm going to hit a nearby station, captain. Come help us out!
This station is giving me a headache. I'd appreciate some help in getting rid of it.
Thanks friend.
Much obliged for the assistance!
Saved my ass for sure. Thank you Captain!
Many thanks cap'n!
Thanks for helping us out!
Your assistance is appreciated captain.
I owe you one friend!
Thanks cap'. I really appreciate it.
Thanks for the aid captain.
Thanks man! I couldn't have done it without you.
Much obliged, captain.
Captain! One of our guests from LGM spilled coffee over phase stabilization hardware. All stabilizers have gone haywire.
We've been reduced to Planck scale. What we're seeing now is the very fabric of the universe - the Quantum foam!!! Quantum fluctuations are now potent enough to rip the ship apart.
We're surrounded by numerous fluctuations which could affect our ship in unexpected ways if we're not careful. Our chief engineer claims that on our way here we've created a counter-fluctuation of our own which holds the key frequency that we can use to set up inverse phase stabilizers and return to our normal size.
