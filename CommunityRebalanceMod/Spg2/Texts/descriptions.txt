This strange item was retrieved from one of those strange structures appearing all over Gemini. Their origin, composition and purpose are yet unknown, but I'll gather them all and when the time is right, sell them for a nice profit. I can always count on art collectors to be interested.

Iolian Pact was formed through a mutual agreement of MultiOps and interested independant sectors after the last civil war with a single goal: economic wealth and security through mutual interests of all parties. Iolian Pact is formally a democratic state with the president as head figure, but it is well known that all decisions are made on congresses organized by MultiOps. Currently the presidential position is held by James Woolridge, a well-known industrialist and former CEO of MultiOps Industries.
Mycaena cluster is a well-known refuge for mercenaries, revenants and former military personnel. Commander Gerrard Fromm, former Directorate admiral holds all power in Mycaena. In the past both Nyx and the Driectorate tried to overtake the region, but both failed when they reached Masada, the most powerful and well-defended station in Gemini. Highly organized tactics and brilliant defense strategies proved to be too tough to beat every time. Seeing as they offer their services as mercenaries, most factions conclude it is better to be on their good side if they ever need to hire them.
Nyxian Consortium is an alliance of powerful and more importantly very wealthy city states originating on planet Nyx. It is one of the oldest organized states in Gemini, with their history stretching back to the time of the first civil war. After the Empire invaded Gemini, Nyx got involved with them expecting their fast victory, all with the goal to be a part of the new governing structure. Ever since the Empire slowed down and halted their conquest, the relations between Nyx and the Empire have been growing colder.
Traders Association is a powerful organization of wealthy traders and companies. They posess no military of their own, but hire mercenary groups to protect them and their investments. Their ability to circumvent any trade embargo or supply deficit makes them a very powerful friend to have. In general they don't deal with petty conflicts directly; they just tend to profit from them.
One man's trash is another man's treasure, it is said. Wastelanders take that very seriously. What started out as a loose guild of dangerous waste disposers ended up as a more or less organized state with the Wasteland region as their foothold. Travelers mostly steer clear of their territory due to the danger of extreme radiation. It is said, though not confirmed, that Wastelanders have contracts with almost all Gemini factions to dispose of their unwanted dangerous waste; contracts worth billions of Credits. They aren't liked by anyone, but tolerated by all except Nexus. Ruins of Tesla station, found in the Wastelands is a point of constant bickering and conflict between the two neighbors.
Nexus is one of the most secretive and isolated states in Gemini. Thomas Scott, a renowned scientist and fighter for a unified Gemini, is now a reclusive, but authoritative figure in Nexus. What information does come from Nexus speak of radical ideas of pacifying Gemini by any means necessary. That information was never confirmed. One thing is certain, entering Nexus territory without permission never ends well. Disappearance of several hundred ships can be directly linked to the Nexus security force.
Gemini Protectorate is what is left of the once great Gemini League; a powerful organization that aimed to free Gemini from Imperial oppression and bring peace to all its citizens. Protectorate territory is centered on Freiburg, one of their main strongholds in the last civil war. It is currently led by Dmitry Kuzhev, but rumors say the Protectorate is in peril of being ripped apart by internal power struggle. Such rumors have not yet been confirmed.
Trinity Free States came to existence as an attempt of several independent sectors to gain strength and influence in the Gemini political scene. Their somewhat pacifistic alignment makes them a very desirable target for rogue elements, which is why Trinity endorsed the Gladius group, the strongest mercenary group in Gemini, to create its headquarters inside Trinity borders. Trinity's main focus is trade and transport, though that is slowly changing as their power grows.
The Directorate was once the Imperial right hand in Gemini, but has now fallen to be one of its worst enemies. In a world where their former master needs them no longer, the Directorate is slowly but firmly finding its own heading. They have proven to be masters of adaptation. Even surrounded by enemies that greatly exceed them in numbers, they have persisted and managed to form a stable, though totalitarian regime. Political analysts believe the Directorate's on-going war with the Empire will ultimately be their undoing.
After the Gateway wormhole to the Empire mainspace was reopened, vast Imperial fleets pushed into Gemini, lashing at all those who oppose them. Their advance was fast, but eventually slowed down, though not before they made a significant foothold in the star system. Powerful Gemini factions can only suspect what their final intentions are, but at the moment the Imperial giant stands still in the center of Gemini. The Imperial enclave in Gemini is commanded by Grand Admiral Cavurian. For all intents and purposes, he is the military commander and political leader of Empire in Gemini.
Baeldor Republic is one of the oldest Gemini factions, originating from the time of the first civil war that ravaged the system. It has undergone major restructuring during the last decade, creating what is today a trilateral democratic federation of three semi-independent baronies. All three share the senate as equals, with the presiding chairman as the spokesman who holds no direct power of decision making, but does have a certain degree of influence. This position has been held by Carlos Figueroa, a distinguished Baeldor military figure, for two consecutive 4 year terms and if it wasn't for him, the Republic would probably be no more. Independence movements in the baronies have been gradually gaining strength and analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the Republic splits.
In the aftermath of the second Gemini war, strength of the former Korkyran Triumvirate has diminished. Weakened by inner elements, the Triumvirate eventually split in two. Korkyra as the more free-minded, more democratic state and Thaurian Alliance that stayed obsessively true to the basic fundamental ideas of the Triumvirate's autocratic policies. Grand Arbiter still holds the most power in Korkyra, but the state has undergone drastic changes in its political structure. The most important change is that the government is now elected by the people and security forces are no longer arbiter-appointed judicators, but conscripted and volunteered soldiers. War with the Thaurian Alliance still rages across Heraclean stretch and Land of despair; with no end in sight.
Gemini Space Engineering (GSE) is a corporation employed on all of the largest constructions in Gemini. Almost all post-war structures were constructed by the GSE. The corporation started out as a joint relief effort by the former Korkyran Triumvirate, Gemini League and the newly formed Trinity Free states to aid the ravaged regions of Gemini. After several years, harsh times fell upon the Trimuvirate causing it to split into two and the League to dissipate. The GSE prevailed however by the sheer power of accumulated Credits and connections, but perhaps more importantly... they were too important. Progress of the entire star system depended on quick expansion and construction of spatial behemoths. Only the GSE had the needed production capacity.
Shortly after judicator Christopher Derrick assumed the position of Grand Arbiter of the Korkyran Triumvirate, he started changing the foundation of the Triumvirate structure, shifting the country from an autocratic, despotic regime to a more open and democratic society. In some parts of the Triumvirate this was hailed, while in others it was scorned. Disgruntled judicators and arbiters led their fleets in an attempt to overthrow Derrick, but ultimately failed. The civil war ended in the secession of Aegis, Korkyran border region, which was to become Thaurian Alliance. The Alliance spread further into Union territory by overtaking the ore-rich Tempest region, and into the Crysalys belt which is still disputed by Porphyria. Thaurian military strength however ensured peace treaties were signed. To this day, Thaurian Alliance wages war with Korkyra, rejecting Grand Arbiter Derrick as the ruler.
Barely a year after the end of the second Gemini war, the more disgruntled members and leading guild members, separated from the Miners guild and used their significant influence and funds to rally independent sectors under their rule in what was to become the Union. The monopoly the Union enjoys on mineral extraction in their ore-rich territories has granted them a place of power and influence. Politically the Union's organization resembles that of a gigantic corporation, led by two executives. Currently those positions are filled by Helmut Spitz and Vanessa Burton.
Sanctuary is led by the self-proclaimed peacekeepers of Gemini. Any aggression in Sanctuary space is met with fierce reaction by their formidable security fleet. Other, more distrusting views of the Sanctuary speak of them as diplomatic traders and spies, willing to sell their knowledge of the Gemini factions to the highest bidder.
There is no stronger brain trust outside of Nexus borders than the Hub. When Nexus commenced its isolationist policy, leaders of the former Gemini League cell from Sagittarius station gave refuge to a large colony of Nexus scientists. From this the Hub was formed. It gradually expanded to occupy its new borders. Nexus however cannot forget their "treason" and rumors of Nexus-funded assassinations in Hub territory have lately been on the rise.
The Triad is an elusive assortment of drug barons, crime lords and other questionable elements, centered on Lunaee station in the Triangle. The organization started out as collectors of Rift dust, a very powerful and highly addictive drug, exclusively found in the Triangle dust cloud. What makes them particularly interesting is the fact that the Triad is slowly but surely molding itself into an organized state. It is suspected they will attempt to influence local outlaw groups in the Outerlands and if they succeed, they just might become a key player in that part of Gemini; perhaps in all of Gemini.
LaGarde family from Mycaena supported the rise of Mycaena as an independent faction after second Imperial invasion. After investing heavily in this endeavor, they were assured in their place as new supreme leaders of Mycaena. However, an army of mercenaries, pirates and freelancers they hired realized they could do a lot better on their own. LaGarde family was hunted down. A few members of that proud and well-connected family, led by so called lord James LaGarde, escaped to Trinity and used their wealth to establish a network of well-paid mercenaries and raiders. Eventually they managed to take hold of a small region now known as LaGarde Province.
MultiOps Industries is probably the most powerful company in Gemini, but even they couldn't turn their heads away from what was going on in the system. New players started to gain ground on them swiftly and like any company, they reorganized and restructured. The result was their alliance with independent sectors to form Iolian Pact which provides them with all the security and boost they needed. Today they are still the leading provider of goods, equipment and ships in Gemini, dwarfing even the Traders Association and Nyxian Consortium in sheer profit.
Omega Transport can trace its roots back to the first colonies in Gemini. It was the main shipping company in the system. Wars that ravaged Gemini left deep scars, however and the company has not yet recovered, if it ever will. The company's primary goal is to offer an alternative to Mars Shipping monopoly.
Madeira Constructs is a deep-space construction oriented company, with its headquarters and factories situated in Nyxian space. Their strong ties to the Consortium are believed by many to be a hindering factor to the company's growth.
As its name implies, Exac Raw Materials primarily deals in mining and refining raw ore and gases. Their vast refineries are able to prepare and ship enormous amounts of materials onto the Gemini market. As is the case with Madeira Constructs, ties to the not-so-beloved Nyxian government are a hindrance, but Exac managed to circumvent that obstacle by signing lucrative deals with the Traders Association.
Neophysics was created and originally led by the legendary scientist Eleanor Ridley. After a while she resigned her position and left Neophysics to continue her work as a freelance scientist. Her alleged "difference of opinion" from Nexus leaders, specifically Thomas Scott, is rumored to have been the main reason for her leaving the company. Corroborating that story is the fact that Neophysics drastically changed its goals and interests since Dr. Ridley's resignation.
In an attempt to break down their scientific research into specific fields, Nexus founded several institutes, organized more like companies to carry out individual portions of R&D. Advanced arms Inc. is one of those institutes that specializes in vessel equipment.
Trinity Armoring Corporation is a government funded company involved in research and development of high-tech weaponry and ship equipment. As Trinity Free States grew in territory, influence and sheer financial power, so did the need to protect all that. TriaCorp was founded to counteract the potential dangers looming on the horizon from all directions.
Gladius Group rose from the ashes of the Mercenary guild decimated by the Gemini League during the last civil war. Their focus is bounty hunting... and they do it extremely well. Most of the new members are tough veterans from all factions, with years of experience under their belt. Gladius Group is led by Manfred Beck, also known as the Reaper, famous for his daring assassinations which he usually conducted in plain sight.
Mars shipping has rooted itself in Gemini industry and trade more than any other company. Their reliability and vast shipping fleet, accompanied by their own security forces are all the insurance other parties need to outsource transport duties to Mars shipping.
Dortmund station situated on the very edge of the Maelstrom region, houses Iontech headquarters. Not surprisingly, their main focus is development of various weapon systems, most of which on contract with the Baeldor government.
Supratravel is Gemini's leading organization in maintaining T-Gate functionality. Their firm grip on monopoly was strengthened further by the company's major investments in upgrading hyper-travel technology. The Riftway grid is the pinnacle of Supratravel R&D sector.
AI Robotics started out as a division of the Hub science council, but as time passed and the group grew stronger, they managed to separate from their "masters" and enter the big scene as an important and independent player.
Versatile is probably the best way to describe Bosseron enterprises. Unlike most companies, this giant has interest in almost all aspects of Gemini life; from food, housing, space construction, weapons manufacturing... If there's Credits to be earned, Bosseron is likely already there, or on the way. Versatility however comes with a price, as the company so far never excelled at any particular field.
During the last days of the Korkyran Triumvirate a special edict was decreed. This edict was the foundation of Heracorp as government-funded research and development institute. All non-essential technology patents were to be sold off to fund the more advanced ideas. As time passed, Heracorp was partially privatized to allow greater expansion and faster development. To this day, Heracorp remains the main R&D consultant and developer of the Korkyran military.
Mendoza foodstuff is a young upstart company founded in Thaurian Alliance by a group of free entrepreneurs. Their declared goal is to bring relief to the ever-growing food market in Gemini and more than anything to prevent great food shortages, like the one that happened several years ago when unusually strong solar radiation destroyed or eradiated vast fertile land on more than half the planets in the system.
Wright chemicals, a leader in the chemical industry sector has always nurtured firm ties with the Thaurian Alliance, proven by the company's HQ in Alliance space. During the last 5 years, Wright chemicals was accused of conducting secret experiments into biological and chemical warfare, supposedly overseen by Thaurian government. No such claims were ever substantiated with credible evidence.
The Miners Guild lost most of its vast influence after the Union was founded. Out of respect or perhaps only nostalgia, Union leaders allowed the Guild to remain within its borders with only a few stations. Almost everything was confiscated in the name of the Union. The Guild remains true to its original ideas as an organization that provides support to independent miners.
Holocom Inc. founded its headquarters in Union held territory. There was much speculation as to "why" the company chose that location. Suspicious minds dare speculate the Union paid Holocom so they may control the company and get unhindered access to the vast amount of information circulating Holocom's ever-spreading network of communication satellites.
Frontier's main goal, as they declared themselves is to overthrow the corrupt Iolian government and expel MultiOps from Iolian Pact. Their heart might be in the right place, but their terrorist activities aren't. Members of the Frontier are wanted for numerous counts of treason, assassination, destruction of government property and terrorism; conveniently they're wanted in Iolian Pact.
"We have every reason to believe that a key part in Genos behavior, philosophy or agenda is in some way linked to eco-radicalism. For now they are but a nuisance, but in the future they might become a threat if not dealt with accordingly. Let it be known that we cannot let anything stop progress of this great Union." - Union regional commissar in "The Genos threat"
The elusive Ghosts of the Aethera nebula... Almost as a rule, coming in contact with them is not good. There are only several noted occasions that the Ghosts even responded to hail attempts, only to destroy the caller moments later. The upside is that so far, their ships were never seen outside Aethera. They cling to the area like they need it.
Syndicate is probably the most organized outlaw group in Gemini. They have connections everywhere even among high ranking officials of the key Gemini factions. It goes so far as one could say they have treaties with the neighboring states to let them in peace... for a cut. One faction however is not likely to give in to bribery. LaGarde Province is their sworn enemy. The Syndicate leaders actually rebelled against the LaGarde family and formed their own organization.
"Live and let live... and plunder." "Winner takes it all." "Finders keepers." ... These are all cliches that Serpent Anarchists hole as creed. Although they're not a homogenous group, their numbers have drastically increased as of late because many new members decided to join the unruly bunch.
Atillas Whip is known to be the source of the Stiletto, a reclusive outlaw group continuously linked to assassinations all over Gemini; their base of operations, their numbers and technology... none of that is known for sure. What is known is that they are a formidable opponent.
The Revenants found their home in the Will O' The Wisp region, right in the Consortium-Nexus crossfire. One could say that would be the end of them, but actually the ongoing war only brings them more "prey". Their raiding parties almost as a rule includes several ships and their battle tactics are a textbook example of military training.
The Niners are small outlaw group operating inside and from the Cloud Nine nebula. They've been a nuisance to Baeldor Republic for years, but all attempts at eradicating them have failed. They always seem to come back.
Gemini League, a freedom fighting group that led vast fleets in the last Gemini war against the Directorate and the Consortium used to control Last Ditch region after overtaking it from local pirates. The League splintered into several groups however after the war ended and the result was full circle back to the beginning. Rogues control Last Ditch once more, but this time they even have former League captains as reinforcements.
The Vanquis are a marginal outlaw formation that is constantly proving to be a nuisance to both Trinity and Gemini Protectorate. Other than raiding small border outposts and passing convoys, they don't seem to have any greater agenda.
The Hexen group is the ruler of a vast area of Gemini called Outerlands. Several attempts to push them out of play proved to be of no use. Their territory is simply too large and unlike most outlaws, they have a firm grasp of military tactics and logistics; almost like they're being either led by someone with military background, or like they're being taught the military way.
"...They seem to revere the phased crystal as sacred to an extent and are willing to guard it with their lives. In a way, it is remarkable and mysterious at the same time, since we can't really ascertain where in Gemini the group originated from. Our best guess is that it's not ethnicity that binds the members together, but rather their beliefs and goals, whatever exactly those may be." - Dr. Auren Sottil, official report to the Hub anthropological society
Although their name suggests otherwise, the Stoners are not an assortment of drug-addicted mindless pirates. Given time and sufficient funding, they'd probably try to organize an official control of Stone Dead region and be acknowledged as one of Gemini states. It is for that goal, the Sanctuary could be funding Stone Dead outlaws, if rumors are to be believed.
For twelve years Heraclean Stretch has been on the forefront of the Triumvirate war. Korkyra and Thauria have been using the region as the focal point of their battles with countless collateral damage in both infrastructure and civilians. The Heraclean Front rose up from those battle-scarred territories to fend off both sides... and to get something for themselves while doing it.
During the last Gemini war, Korkyran Triumvirate was uprooted by treasonous puppet rulers. When Judicator Derrick overthrew the corrupt government, some elements of the old regime fled Korkyra and reached what is today known as Red Mist. Official Korkyran policy is that the Raiders are the remnants of that treasonous regime.
Little is known about this mysterious group. Their existence was confirmed on numerous occasions, but normal, let alone diplomatic relations were never developed. The mystery surrounding their members gave room for outlandish speculation and even conspiracy theories. "The Brotherhood seems like nothing more than a religious cult. They are not a threat, but we should keep one eye open if ever they turn to more extreme behavior." - Leonard Sainz; prominent socio-anthropological expert
Porphyria rose from the ashes of a ravaged territory, partly covered in the mists of the Occulus nebula, and partly clouded by the Aethera dense nebula. The state owes its existence to the former commanders and personnel of Fontenaux station, destroyed in the last Gemini war. Porphyria suffered extensive damage from stasis occurrences and the effects are still felt. What was once a curse, today proves to be a blessing. Porphyria enjoys its independence, however harsh at times, precisely because large Gemini players believe the hardship of conquering Porphyria greatly outweighs the potential benefits. Porphyria is led by Manuel Espinosa, a charismatic governor of Pyros, who earned the trust of his comrades during the initial organization of Porphyria.

Name: Archer "Doubleback" Mc'Ginty<\n>Age : Unknown - Approximately mid 30s<\n> Last reported location: Gemini Sector - District Alpha Sector<\n>I am Archer "Doubleback" Mc'Ginty, Pirate of the Gemini star system. I don't remember much of my youth, only that I started working aboard pirate ships out of Tortuga Bay around the age of 12. I found I had an affinity with piloting Cruiser Class starships, especially at high speeds and tights turns. It was on my first mission as pilot of a heap of junk that I earned my name "Doubleback". There is nothing like hiding in an asteroid field and waiting on freighters running contraband to the outer system stations for quick credits; they were always the best prey. With my skills, I could come in from behind, take out there main engines and then "Doubleback" and come in for the kill before the ship crew even knew what hit 'em. This is the tactics I am famous for and utilize to my best ability each and every day whilst in space. I know time is against me and I know I shall not be one of the old pilots telling war stories in Tortuga Bay bar, but this is something I embrace, not fear. For the day shall eventually come when I am no more than matter in space myself. Archer "Doubleback" Mc'Ginty, Pirate Captain of the Lady Jane "I find it rude to laugh, when I have plasma cannons aimed at your head".
In a universe full of conflict and strife there is always room for another freelancer or mercenary to step in and get their hands dirty. While most only follow the money, Elizabeth has gathered a reputation for being a bit of an idealist mercenary. Often choosing contracts that were more about helping the greater good rather than just lining her pockets. She gained great respect because of this, which in turn did lead to some sizeable contracts and wealth... She very much believes in strength in numbers and following this logic, chooses to command a modified carrier which she painted ruby red. Some say it's to instil fear in her enemies, while others say it just fits her style. No matter what her reasons, it earned her the nickname "The Red Queen".
A descendant of Admiral Marcus Hammerhill, Kate grew up accustomed to military life and eagerly awaited her opportunity to continue her family legacy as soon as she came of age.<\n>Rising through the ranks with a mixture of tactical intuition and sheer brazenness she found her niche as a destroyer captain, the mixture of firepower and maneuverability matching her fighting and command style perfectly.<\n>In keeping with her family namesake, Kate is infamous for "dropping the hammer" on foes, preferring the heavy punch of railguns and other hard ammo weaponry to devastate foes and soften up larger targets for finishing blows by other vessels.<\n>After losing her wife Jasmine in a raider attack, she has burning hatred for pirates and has been known to sometimes get in over her head and put her ship at questionable risk in relentless pursuit of justice.
Neither friend nor foe, Mercadier de Molay owes his allegiance to the guy with the biggest bank account second and to himself first. A true opportunist, de Molay ensures you always draw the short stick. Legends of his exploits elicit shock and awe, fear and reverence. One star date he'll reduce a dreadnought to cosmic dust - alone - in his heavily modified gunship for a stockpile of creds and the next he'll lead a daring rescue against blood driven raiders for an outlying mining colony for not more than a ham sandwich. Mercadier's past isn't shrouded in mystery, a jigsaw puzzle to be pieced together bit by bit. Everyone knows Mercadier, his triumphs in past wars - on either side - as well as his penchant for exotic delicacies; everyone knows about his co-pilot, an allegedly bio-mechanical orange "feline" from a back water planet at the edge of the galaxy; and everyone grudgingly knows that Mercadier de Molay is the best damn pilot to ever traverse the stars; but very few know the man himself. And that very few know what de Molay wants them to know: whatever it takes to secure the upper hand.
Malcheor is the best at what he does and that is getting people where they need to go. It can be into places or out of places, for the right price he can get you there. He grew up on the streets where he learned how to survive, the hard way. Now those skills are used to help those in need, whether it be for money or trade.
Captain Jack Blade started his career as a freelance pirate slowly making a name for himself throughout Gemini. He met up with a rival pirate leader and after killing him took charge of his new found gang. It was not long after that when his exploits started to become widely known and equally feared among the private trading corporations. He is considered a hero among many for his generous donations to the needy, some even comparing him to the fabled robin hood...

It is demolished beyond repair. One could probably salvage valuable alloys from it.
The quality of the alloys has deteriorated due to constant long term exposure to radiation.
This wreckage doesn't cast any shadows. Most likely due to a fatal malfunction in the phaseshift hardware.
The hull is disproportionally stretched due to an abrupt plunge out of a Torrent into normal space.
The state of the hull indicates it was melted by plasma weaponry.
The hull was cut clean by beam weapons into large fragments.
Clear signs of a fusion-based detonation on the broadside indicate that it was involved in an all out battle.
The Best buy / sell database offers an overview of the local planetary and station prices.
Each station or planet listed in the best buy or best sell list had to be visited beforehand.
The Local price is the default price on that station or planet.
The Last price is the last known price at the time of the most recent visit to that station or planet. It could have been modified by events, officers, licenses, perks, etc...
Distance is equal to the rectilinear distance between your ship's current position and the listed destination.
Two options in the top right corner allow you to easily locate stations either by centering the screen or setting a waypoint.
Selecting a commodity filters the list of stations and planets to only those who buy or sell that particular commodity.
The price listings in the commodity list are unmodified global averages
With Torrent Drive or T-Drive ship can travel at faster than light speeds by reducing the ship's mass. T-Drive is advised to be used cautiously, executing smaller jump ranges, and thus limiting stress on a ship.
CORRION - "The water world". Mild atmosphere attracted many colonists to settle here, but vast oceans on this waterworld challenged engineers greatly. Today this peaceful world remains one of the least urbanized, but also most preserved environments in Gemini.
EANAKAI - "Tropical paradise". This world has only a few landmasses, but dangerous creatures living deep inland prevented serious colonization. Most cities are built in protected coastal areas of the continents. The last three decades have seen most of the cities of this world struggling to rebuild from global super earthquake that caused almost complete devastation.
FAIRUZ - "Megafactory". Abundance of natural resources made it a perfect place to jump-start an entire Gemini production following the start of serious colonization. Due to its high manufacturing value, Fairuz was also the target of many wars and invasions. Last one was during first Gemini war when Directorate forces conducted sustained orbital bombardment that resulted in global environmental catastrophe. Today, Fairuz is a crippled planet with toxic atmosphere, but still succeeds to maintain the bulk of its industrial production based on imported raw materials.
KORKYRA - dark and cold planet with very few water surfaces. Korkyra is the homeworld of the former Korkyran Triumvirate. People of Korkyra are a disciplined and proud nation, with unmatched respect for its mighty military and social hierarchy. Cities are huge, modern and functional with no room for beauty or designers' ingenuity. This world has avoided any major destruction throughout Gemini history, since it has established itself as an "impossible" target for decades.
NYX - Homeworld of the Nyxian Consortium. This green world is covered with massive jungles and rich wildlife. After initial colonization, Nyxian local authorities started a full scale terraforming project aimed to reconfigure the planet to match Earth in its likeness. Project failed but genetic mutation on local wildlife caused increased spread of forests and animals. Today, all urban areas are separated with barriers that require constant maintenance. Human presence outside of these areas is minimal.
THAURIA - "The barren world". Thauria is the second largest planet in Korkyran territory. It supports human life just barely. Inhabitants are a sturdy, proud people that value military life just like their Korkyran counterparts. For the last several years, this planet has been the center of rebellion against the Korkyran government. During this war, Thauria has been repeatedly besieged and attacked, but remains strong and undefeated.
TRINITY - "New Earth". Maybe the most perfect planet for human civilization in Gemini. Its early development was hampered by numerous disputes between the local colonist groups. After major colonization began, Imperial forces had to undertake three military operations just to ensure peace and order. This bad start was never caught up with. Today, Trinity is the center of the Trinity Free States and enjoys the longest time of relative peace in recent history.
IOLIA - "Ice globe". Iolia is the central planet of the Iolian Pact. The planet itself as a major trading and transit hub. Dozens of shady semi-legal groups operate from this world and their activities make Iolia a very unsettling and dangerous place to live in. The most powerful Gemini company, MultiOps, succeeds to maintain order only in several major cities where they established the biggest weapon manufacturing plants in the entire Gemini.
PYROS - "Hell-pit". Pyros is a world of million volcanoes. Surface is very dangerous and cities are buils in protected domes or underground. Despite all percautions, natural disasters are frequent and Pyros remains most unpopulated planet to this day. Some areas of this world are considered smugglers paradise, but reluctance of any territorial faction to unleash a major military operation offered criminal syndicates a chance to properly entrench themselves for a long period.
SORA - The Dark-lab". Sora is the homeworld of the Nexus and its appearance follows the philosophy of its rulers to the letter. The planet is in essence one huge scientific hub. Super-modern cities blend together with natural surroundings and all of its resources are used to power the thousands of laboratories and testing sites. The nature of Nexus is secretive and elusive so not much is known about planet surface and its populace, but their paranoia of outsiders led them to the take a more aggressive and militaristic stance.
CARTHAGENA - "The foothold". Carthagena served as the capital for all Imperial and Directorate institutions. This planet had the perfect atmosphere and environment and was closest to the Starpoint. The result was very rapid urbanization and development. Some called this world "the jewel of Gemini"<\n>At the end of the first Gemini war, tragedy later named "Starpoint incident" obliterated the entire planet. Most of the planet's population was wiped out and all cities destroyed. Slow recolonization started many years after, but just looking at this world today reveals that it will never reach even the fraction of its former glory.
BAELDOR - Capital of the Baeldor Republic. This highly urbanized planet is the greatest achievement of human colonization in Gemini, and after the destruction of Carthagena, the most densely populated world in the entire system. Great cities of majestic beauty were built to stand as a monument to human success in deep space. Baeldor suffered greatly in both Gemini wars, but the resilient people repeatedly rose from the ashes and rebuilt their dream.
HOGOSHA - "Thousand sky-cities". The only completely successfully terraformed planet in Gemini. Hogosha was the last planet to be colonized. Rolling green hills and endless waterfalls hide the fact Hogosha was in fact a desert world. For fifty years engineers constructed gigantic flying platforms all over planet. They were in essence terraforming pods. After the process was completed, these platforms were used to house cities for the new colonists. Today, although rather unpopulated, Hogosha stands as the best testament to what humans can achieve even in the worst of environments.
