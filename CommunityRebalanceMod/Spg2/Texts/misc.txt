To fire LIGHT weapons (uses battery energy) press <Cffff00ff><ST_Fire_Light_Weapons><C>.
To fire HEAVY weapons (uses ammo, requires TARGET LOCK: <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Lock><C>) press <Cffff00ff><ST_Fire_Heavy_Weapons><C>.
There are FRONT, REAR, LEFT and RIGHT batteries, each battery consists of at least one turret.
Also, there are 2 BATTERY TYPES - LIGHT and HEAVY, each of them holds corresponding weapon type (light turrets or heavy punchers).
Use the Fire at will command (<Cffff00ff><ST_Fire_at_Will_(Toggle)><C>) to command your weapon batteries to autonomously choose targets and fire at them if they are in range and firing arc. Be careful, as stronger opponents might require a more concentrated firepower and that is best achieved by manually aiming and firing.
Target your nearest enemy by pressing the <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Nearest_Enemy><C> button and clear target lock with the <Cffff00ff><ST_Clear_Target><C>.
CAMERA & CONTROL MODES
Use the <Cffff00ff><ST_Switch_Camera><C> shortcut to switch between camera modes.
Normal camera follows your ship, while Turret view allows full 360 degrees view around the ship. Turret view is especially useful when commanding large ships with weapon turrets placed all around the ship.
Use the <Cffff00ff><ST_Cursor_Flight_/_Select><C> shortcut to switch between two control modes.
Selection mode allows you to click on the HUD buttons with the mouse, while Targeting mode links your ship movement to your mouse cursor. While in Targeting mode, you steer the ship with the mouse.
TARGETING RETICLE
Depending on the situation and what it's hovering over, the cursor can change its shape. While hovering over space in the main viewport it changes into the TARGETING RETICLE. 
Along with showing you where your turrets are aiming, the targeting reticle also shows you the status of your weapons. Power levels of your currently active weapon battery is shown on the LEFT of the reticle, while reload of your currently active heavy weapon battery is shown on the RIGHT. Heavy weapons can ONLY be fired on a LOCKED ON target!
The targeting reticle changes color depending on the alignment of the object it is hovering over. It turns RED over ENEMIES.
TARGET LOCK & QUICK TARGET SCAN
To lock on a target, hover the cursor over the object and press the Target lock button <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Lock><C>.
The TARGET LOCK becomes visible with all its useful data on the targeted object. Available data depends on the type of the targeted object, but for ships as your most frequent enemy they are as follows:
The HULL bar shows how much damage the ship can take before exploding.
The SHIELDS bar shows the general status of all of its four shields. For a detailed "per-shield" info, check the Context menu while the ship is locked on.
Distance tells you how far the object is.
Experience level gives you a general idea of the objects overall strength.
Special status warns you if the locked on object is a Veteran or Hero. This is important mainly for ships. Be wary of Veterans and especially Heroes. They are much more powerful than their standard counterparts.
Quick target scan opens up alongside the targeted ship that shows a more detailed overview of the target's status (shields, threat level...).
A small icon will appear on the target lock to indicate whether the object is specifically marked as target for your mercenaries and fighters.
More useful targeting shortcuts:<\n>Clear target lock: <Cffff00ff><ST_Clear_Target><C><\n>Target nearest hostile: <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Nearest_Enemy><C><\n>Target previous object: <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Previous_Object><C><\n>Target next object: <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Next_Object><C><\n>Target previous hostile object: <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Previous_Enemy><C><\n>Target next hostile object: <Cffff00ff><ST_Target_Next_Enemy><C><\n>
CAPTAIN INFO - PERSONAL (<Cffff00ff><ST_Captain_Info><C>)

The bottom of the panel is reserved for all bonuses currently applied to your ship. This section gets more populated as you progress further in the game.

Every time you ANCHOR on a station, or land on a planet, your game is AUTOSAVED.
You can also SAVE through the MENU on the right console, but ONLY WHEN LANDED.
Gemini News Network reel constantly rolls at the top of the screen to show various news happening around Gemini (historic news, commodity prices, bounty information...)
Use the SHIPYARD to compare your ship with available ships and if you so desire, purchase new ships.
The DRYDOCK is the only place where you can fully upgrade your ship by purchasing new ship systems or by enhancing them in various ways. You can also upgrade your light weapon batteries by adding new turrets, purchase ammunition for your heavy weapons and buy additional usable equipment.
If you're more into bartering than fighting, check the local TRADER to buy or sell commodities.
The NEWS section shows you the latest happenings around Gemini as well as historic data.
HIRING section gives the opportunity to employ new officers on key positions of your ship. Officers provide passive bonuses, but be careful; they expect regular salary.

The right side can be switched to show either your own system inventory so you can mount systems from your inventory, or it can show what the station/planet has to offer for purchase.
Click on a weapon mount, select a weapon on the right-handed list and click the MOUNT button to install the system. Purchasing directly from the station will automatically install the system on-board.
If you're purchasing a new system onto an already filled weapon slot, the old system is automatically transferred to your system inventory.
To UNMOUNT a weapon from a slot, select the slot, and click the UNMOUNT button.
The last button changes depending on what type of system is selected. Light weapons allow ADDITIONAL TURRETS to be purchased by clicking on the ADD TURRET button, while Heavy weapons allow AMMO to be purchased for the selected weapon.

Every station/planet has a limited supply of available Troopers (replenished over time).
You can hire up to three officers, each on his/her corresponding function (Tactical, Engineering, Navigation) and each bring their own set of special bonuses. The bonuses remain active for as long as the providing officer is onboard.
Officers come with an initial cost as well as monthly pay. If you run out of funds and can't pay your Officers salaries, they will LEAVE!

Occasionally you can find derelicts floating in space. You can loot these by simply firing at them and destroying them.
Alternatively you can use the Scavenger swarm equipment. This will provide more loot.
ACCESSING THE T-GATE GRID
Hyperspace torrent gates can be found in all high-traffic areas of Gemini. Anchor on a Tgate to use it. Each Tgate jump comes with a Credit cost.
USING STRUCTURES
Various structures in Gemini can be used by anchoring on them. Automated repair stations can for example repair your ship's hull for a price.
MINING ASTEROIDS
Shoot at asteroids to break them apart. Valuable ore will then be dropped. You can collect this ore and sell it on stations or planets for profit.
Using Borehole discharge or similar equipment provides more loot.
RIFTWAY "SURFING"
Riftways are hyperspace lanes laid across Gemini. Fly inside a Riftway to gain increased speed.
USING T-DRIVE
T-Drive is a special piece of equipment you can place in your equipment quick-bar. Clicking on the T-Drive opens up the Starchart where you can set your destination. Jump distance is automatically calculated depending on the number of T-Drive charges you currently have. Click on the destination to initiate T-Drive jump.
BOARDING & CAPTURING SHIPS
BOARDING a ship is done through the CONTEXT MENU (<Cffff00ff><ST_Context_Menu_(Toggle)><C>) when a ship is targeted.
By LEFT-CLICKING on the BOARDING icon, you commence the boarding action and send your troopers via transporter to the targeted vessel.
A small SIDE OVERVIEW opens up on your right where you can see how boarding is playing out. Here you can SEND OVER ADDITIONAL TROOPS, depending on your TRANSPORTER system efficiency or order a FULL RETREAT.
When boarding succeeds, the target is captured. The ship is rendered INACTIVE and its icon on the small right-hand panel is checked.
To lock on a captured ship, you can also LEFT-CLICK its CAPTURED icon on your right.
After you've captured a ship, you can exercise your rights on it (when targeted) through the CONTEXT MENU, be that LOOT, DEMOLISH or GRAPPLE a ship and tow it to a nearby station or planet to sell it or store in your garage.
OBJECT & QUEST MARKERS
Objects within your sensor radius are marked with object markers.
Color of the object marker depends on the object's alignment towards you (hostile = red)
Quest objects are specially marked for easier recognition depending on mission type (main, side, freelance).
MISSIONS & MISSION OBJECTIVES
This is a MISSION WAYPOINT. It helps you find your mission objectives in space.
You can review your missions in your CAPTAIN'S LOG screen (<Cffff00ff><ST_Captain's_Log><C>) and render any of them ACTIVE, which makes its waypoint visible on your HUD.
Objectives of a mission you're currently FOLLOWING are shown on your HUD
You can also select a mission on your starchart and it is immediately being FOLLOWED
MERCENARIES
Mercenary ships can be hired on stations and planets to accompany you on your travels. Beside the hiring fee, mercenaries also require monthly salaries. Be sure to have enough Credits to pay salaries to you hired mercenaries as they will leave your service if they don't get paid. Or worse, they could decide to beat their payment from you.
SKILLS PANEL
The Skills panel provides a convenient way to look over and more importantly upgrade your Skills the way you want to.
Spend Skill points you've gained by leveling-up or as rewards for quests and achievements, by clicking on the skill modifiers located below each skill.
Hover the mouse over a Skill modifier to see its benefits.
Activating additional modifiers increases how much Power the skill requires for activation.
Skills can only be reset on stations Spire and Tortuga bay, but it will cost you!
PERKS PANEL
Perks are special passive bonuses you can activate and upgrade by spending Perk points.
Perk points are received when gaining a new Rank, and also as special rewards for quests and achievements.
Hover the mouse over a Perk to see its benefits.
Space can sometimes become quite disorienting. Use the Align to plane (<Cffff00ff><ST_Align_with_Plane><C>) holo-projection to help you navigate through space. Pressing Align to plane button gives the order to your crew to automatically align your ship according to the star system plane. Along with showing you the general  directions the holo-projection also shows planar orientation and vertical offset from the star system zero "elevation".
Use the REARM button to fill your Heavy weapons ammunition (all heavy weapon batteries).
LAUNCHING FIGHTERS
Some ships have a hangar with up to three fighter wing slots.
Fighter wings can be purchased on stations and planets via the DRYDOCK -> LOADOUT panel.
Fighter are launched by pressing the Launch all fighters button (<Cffff00ff><ST_Launch_All_(Toggle)><C>) on the Context menu (<Cffff00ff><ST_Context_Menu_(Toggle)><C>)
Alternatively, you can launch individual fighter wings by pressing the appropriate button on the Context menu (<Cffff00ff><ST_Context_Menu_(Toggle)><C>) or the shortcuts:<\n>Launch wing one: <Cffff00ff><ST_Launch_Wing_1_(Toggle)><C><\n>Launch wing two: <Cffff00ff><ST_Launch_Wing_2_(Toggle)><C><\n>Launch wing three: <Cffff00ff><ST_Launch_Wing_3_(Toggle)><C>
Once launched, fighter wings remain on mission until their mission is cancelled or they get destroyed.
The small panels that appear on the left side of the HUD, show status of each of your wings "on mission".
If ALL fighter crafts in a wing get destroyed, you MUST purchase a completely new fighter wing on a station or planet. Otherwise, the wing gets repaired over time or when anchored.
You can also see how much fuel each of your wings has left on the Context Menu (<Cffff00ff><ST_Context_Menu_(Toggle)><C>). When the bar on each icon is green it shows how much fuel they have left before they must return to your ship. When the bar is ORANGE, it shows refueling status.
